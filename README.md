# CT-GAN
Developed a Conditional GAN (CT-GAN) system for text-to-image synthesis, enabling the generation of high-quality images from textual descriptions. The project follows a multi-stage GAN architecture that refines image outputs from low to high resolution (64×64 → 128×128 → 256×256), conditioned on char-CNN-RNN text embeddings.
